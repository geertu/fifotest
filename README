Serial FIFO Test Program
------------------------

"fifotest" is a test program for checking the integrity of the serial port
FIFOs.

Features:
  - Opens and closes the serial port for each message,
  - Sends variable length messages,
  - Consumes received messages partly (the remainder is supposed to be
    flushed),
  - Data is generated randomly, using a seed for reproducability (seed zero
    means pseudo-random),
  - Received data is verified against the expected data


Usage:

    fifotest: [options] <txdev> <rxdev>

    Valid options are:
	-h, --help       Display this usage information
	-i, --seed       Initial seed (zero is pseudorandom)
	-l, --len        Maximum message length (default 1024, must be <= 4096)
	-n               Number of messages to send (default zero is unlimited)
	-s, --speed      Serial speed
	-v, --verbose    Enable verbose mode

    The first device specified is used for output, the second device is used
    for input.


Examples:

  * Transmitting from ttyS0 to ttyS1:

	fifotest /dev/ttyS0 /dev/ttyS1 -s 1000000 -n 10

    Wiring:
        TXD0 -> RXD1
